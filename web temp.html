                <p class="featured-desc ">Sixty years ago, in an obscure corner of Africa, the only survivor of a light aircraft crash was a baby boy. Perhaps it was the miracle of his survival that gave him the gift of “sight,” and he became a Sangoma, the seer of the Kuvuki
                    tribe, interpreting the wishes of The Great One through the throwing of the bones. Hence his name, “Bones.” Today, at an advanced age but still fit in mind and body, his mission is to pass on his wisdom to his son, Mathambo, and guide
                    him into manhood – a mission doomed to fail because of both of their obsessive personalities.
